## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

Laravel MongoDB
===============

[![Latest Stable Version](http://img.shields.io/github/release/mongodb/laravel-mongodb.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/mongodb/laravel-mongodb)
[![Total Downloads](http://img.shields.io/packagist/dm/mongodb/laravel-mongodb.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/mongodb/laravel-mongodb)
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/mongodb/laravel-mongodb/build-ci.yml)](https://github.com/mongodb/laravel-mongodb/actions/workflows/build-ci.yml)

This package adds functionalities to the Eloquent model and Query builder for MongoDB, using the original Laravel API.
*This library extends the original Laravel classes, so it uses exactly the same methods.*

This package was renamed to `mongodb/laravel-mongodb` because of a transfer of ownership to MongoDB, Inc.
It is compatible with Laravel 10.x. For older versions of Laravel, please refer to the
[old versions](https://github.com/mongodb/laravel-mongodb/tree/3.9#laravel-version-compatibility).
